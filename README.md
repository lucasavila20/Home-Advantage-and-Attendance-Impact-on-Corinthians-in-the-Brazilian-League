Home Advantage and Attendance Impact on Match Outcomes: An Analysis of Corinthians in the Brazilian League


In this project I used the RStudio's feature 'Quarto' that allows to build a book. On this, I will analyse how impactful is the home advantage and the attendance on Corinthians's games result. Through the project I worked on web scrap, data visualization both on Power BI and R, and data modeling, using simple and advanced statistical methods.

Note that the scrips are embbeded on the book, but I am also uploading the modeling script.

My account do not allow me to share a link with my PowerBI dashboards, so I am just leaving a screeshot on the PowerBI_corinthians.png file.


All my though process is described on the book, so if you feel like there is no progress being made on some sections, that is probably true, but I guess it is important to register how the work was done
